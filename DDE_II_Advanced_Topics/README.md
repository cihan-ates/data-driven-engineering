# Welcome to "Advanced Topics"

[![image](others/images/ml2.png)](https://www.its.kit.edu/Lehrveranstaltungen_DataDrivenEngineering_II.php)

In the second lecture, we dive into the details of the most recent applications in data driven engineering within the scope of machine learning. Building upon the skills developed in the first course, we visit complex model architectures through different “themes”, with the objective of providing a deeper background and capability to navigate through the recent developments in the field. The [content](/DDE_II_Advanced_Topics/Lecture%20outline.pdf) is updated every year, reflecting the recent developments in the field.

The second lecture is also integrated with group projects. Here  groups of students are assigned open-ended research problems with scientific mentors from ITS at the beginning of the semester. In the following weeks, the groups work on their problems by combining the fundamental skills they gained in the first and second lectures. The progress will be monitored via project sessions throughout the semester. The finalized work will be presented at the end of the semester and published in the lecture repository.
