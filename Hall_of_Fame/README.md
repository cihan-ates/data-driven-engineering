# Best Project Contest: Hall of Fame

At the end of each lecture period, we are organizing best project contest, $`(KI)^2T`$, during which the finalists present their work. The best is decided by the votes of the audience! 

We will update the list every semester. We thank our finalists for their excellent work and sharing their project files with us!
