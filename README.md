# Data Driven Engineering



Engineering disciple stems from the ingenuity and the ability to contrive. This heritage has also been reflected on how the raw data is processed into information and distilled into engineering wisdom. Since its dawn, engineers have been dealing with massive amounts of data accumulated over decades of fundamental experiments and field measurements, vitalized in the form of cleverly organized charts, tables and heuristic laws. In the last few decades, our capability to generate data has increased even further with the developments in (i) the measurement techniques including the sensing technologies, (ii) computational power, (iii) faster, easier and cheaper data transfer and storage, (iv) post-processing tools and algorithms. In this regard, machine learning (ML) can be interpreted as a powerful tool that augments the traditional “wisdom distillation process” via automatic identification of the patterns hidden within the data.   

This lecture series focus on the fundamentals of intelligence and ML methodologies that can be utilized to solve engineering problems. In the first lecture, you will build up the basic skills needed to develop intelligent solutions for pattern recognition in experimental/numerical datasets, model abstractions, optimization and process control. Another objective is to establish a strong scientific background in order to clarify the current capabilities, challenges and opportunities in ML. The course includes weekly software sessions, organized as jupyter notebooks for hands-on experience and finalizes with an End-to-End Machine Learning Project. 

At the end of the lecture period, we are organizing best project contest, $`(KI)^2T`$, during which the finalists present their work. The best is decided by the votes of the audience! Feel free to explore these projects, which are available in the "Hall of Fame".
